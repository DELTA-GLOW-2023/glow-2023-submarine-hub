Welcome to the most innovative, out-of-this-world, and slightly nonsensical project - the **Glow 2023 Submarine Hub**. This project combines the elegance of a submarine with the luminance of a glow stick. Why? Well, why not?

## What is Glow 2023 Submarine Hub?

In the depths of the GitHub ocean, there lies a mysterious project called "Glow 2023 Submarine Hub." This hub is like no other - it's a magical fusion of submarine technology and glow-in-the-dark goodness.

Imagine a submarine that glows with the power of a thousand suns, navigating through the darkest depths of the web. But, there's more to it than just aesthetics. This underwater disco party also serves as a reverse proxy, connecting you to the underwater wonders of the internet.

## Features

- 🌊 **Submersible Connection**: Dive deep into the abyss of the web, all from the safety of your submarine.
- ✨ **Glow Power**: Our submarine hub glows brighter than your future, thanks to advanced glow stick technology.
- 🌐 **WebSockets**: Seamlessly communicate with the marine life of the internet using WebSockets.
- 🚀 **Express Yourself**: Powered by Node.js and Express, because even submarines need a little expressivity.
